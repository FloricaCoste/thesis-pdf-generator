#   Testing #

To build better and more reliable applications, whenever you write a new line of code, you should test your code using both functional and unit tests.
Symfony integrates with an independent library - called PHPUnit - to give you a rich testing framework.

All test are automatically saved in the tests/

A unit test is a test against a single PHP class, when functional tests check the integration of the different layers of an application

You can test your application with the following command:

*   for full application:

        $   phpunit

*   for entire Bundle:

        $   phpunit tests/AppBundle/

*   for a class:

        $   phpunit tests/AppBundle/Entity/ {name of class}

A function test have a very specific workflow:
                
*   Make a request;
*   Test the response;
*   Click on a link or submit a form;
*   Test the response;
*   Rinse and repeat.

Each application has its own PHPUnit configuration, stored in the phpunit.xml.dist file. only the tests stored in /tests are run via the phpunit command. You can add more directory to be tested in phpunit.xml.dist
