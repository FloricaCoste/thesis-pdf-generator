## Creating Symfony Applications with Composer
    
          $   composer create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition [project name without brackets]
          
![Initialize a symphony project. \label{choice_list}](./06_figures/fig_06_01.png)
  
Press enters for DB connections and later when you need to change it, got to { parameters.yml } file and modify them

![Initialize DB connections for project. \label{choice_list}](./06_figures/fig_06_02.png)

Running a Symfony application is a matter of browsing to the project directory and executing this command:

    $   cd [project name without brackets]
  
Run the local host to make sure that the configuration went well. 

    $   php bin/console server:run
   
As a result, if you open the browser and access the http://localhost:8000/ you can see the Welcome Page of Symfony:

![Welcome Page of Symfony. \label{choice_list}](./06_figures/fig_06_03.png)

It any error occur than you will need to Fix File Permissions


## Object Oriented in PHP versus Sympfony 

Before I move on to work with Symfony I spend some time to understand functions, variables, conditionals and loops in PHP. I will use as an example a class call product to illustrate the different between.
 
 ####    Create a simple PHP class (Product.php)
 In php You define a class by starting with the keyword ‘class’ followed by the name you want to give your new class. The next step is to add data to your class. One of the big differences between functions and classes is that a class contains both data (variables) and functions that form a package called an: ‘object’.
 When you create a variable inside a class, it is called a ‘property’.
 
         <?php 
            class product {
                var $ product_name;
            }
         ?>
 
 The data/variables inside a class (ex: var $ product_name;) are called ‘properties’. Add functions/methods to your class. 
 In the same way that variables get a different name when created inside a class (they are called: properties) functions also referred to (by nerds) by a different name when created inside a class – they are called ‘methods’.
 A class’s methods are used to manipulate its own data / properties.
 
         <?php 
            class product {
                var $ product_name;
                function set_ product_name ($new_ product_name) {
                    $this-> product_name = $new_ product_name;
                }
                function get_ product_name () {
                    return $this-> product_name;
                }
            }
         ?>
 Getter and setter functions
 To be able to operate with a class we have to define - functions/methods: get_ product_name () and set_ product_name ().It is a convention that getter and setter names should match the property names.

 The getter and setter product_names, match the associated property name.
 
 This way, when other PHP programmers want to use your objects, they will know that if you have a method/function called ‘set_ product_name ()’, there will be a property/variable called ‘product_name’.
 
####  Create a Symfony class 

You can follow the same steps to create a new class in Symfony, but the advantage of using Symfony is that you can use the generate:doctrine:entity command on the command line.

       $ php bin/console generate:doctrine:entity

This command generates a new Doctrine entity stub including the mapping definition and the class properties, getters and setters.
![Create a new class. \label{choice_list}](./06_figures/fig_06_04.png)

By default, the command is run in the interactive mode and asks questions to determine the bundle name, location, configuration format and default structure:

![Create a new class in interactive mode. \label{choice_list}](./06_figures/fig_06_05.png)

The command can be run in a non-interactive mode by using the --no-interaction option, but you need to pass all needed options:

    $ php bin/console generate:doctrine:entity --no-interaction --entity=AcmeBlogBundle:Post --fields="product_name:string(30) product_description:text" --format=xml
    
    
## Create database in MySQL versus generating database with Sympfony 

#### Creating and Selecting a Database in MySQL
    
To create a database in MySQL you need to use the command line:

    mysql> CREATE DATABASE Hotel;

You must refer to databases and tables using the same letter case throughout a given query. It is recommended that always to use the same letter case that was used when the database was created.
When you creating a database does not select it for use; you must do that explicitly. To make Hotel the current database, use this statement:

    mysql> USE Hotel

Once you create your database, you must select it for use each time you begin a MySQL session. You can do this by issuing a USE statement as shown in the example. Alternatively, you can select the database on the command line when you invoke MySQL. Just specify its name after any connection parameters that you might need to provide. For example:

![Connect to database. \label{choice_list}](./06_figures/fig_06_06.png)

####    Creating a Table

Creating the database is the easy part once you deciding what the structure of your database should be: what tables you need and what columns should be in each of them.
For a table that contains a record for each of your Product. This can be called the product table, and it should contain. Once you decide what information you want to keep on the table you can create it

Use a CREATE TABLE statement to specify the layout of your table:

    mysql> CREATE TABLE product (name VARCHAR(30));

#### Generating database with Sympfony

The easiest way to understand how Doctrine works is to see how it is working. 
 
To be able to generate a table in a database you'll configure the database, use the Product object created before, persist it to the database and fetch it back out.

Configuring the Database

Before you really begin, you'll need to configure your database connection information. By convention, this information is usually configured in an app/config/parameters.yml file:

![Connect to database. \label{choice_list}](./06_figures/fig_06_07.png)

Using the following comand we can create the table in database  

    $ php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force
    
 ![Create table. \label{choice_list}](./06_figures/fig_06_08.png)
  
  Now it is the time to check if the table have been added to the database: 
  
 ![See table - if created. \label{choice_list}](./06_figures/fig_06_08.png) 
 
 
 ## OOP with PHP and MySQL versus generating doctrine with Sympfony
 
 ####   OOP with PHP and MySQL
Once we create a table in the class and an entity which match the table it is easy to create, read, update and delete entries in any of your projects, regardless of how the database is designed.
Setting up the skeleton of our class is fairly simple once we figure out exactly what we need. First we need to make sure that we can do our basic MySQL functions. In order to do this, we need the following functions: 
*   Select
*   Insert
*   Delete
*   Update
*   Connect
*   Disconnect

Those seem pretty basic, but going through, we’ll notice that a lot of them utilize some similar aspects, so we may have to create more classes. Here is what your class definition should look like. Notice that I made sure that the methods were created with the public keyword.

        class Database
        {
            public function connect()   {   }
            public function disconnect()    {   }
            public function select()        {   }
            public function insert()        {   }
            public function delete()        {   }
            public function update()    {   }
        }

###### function connect()
This function will be fairly basic, but creating it will require us to first create a few variables. Since we want to make sure that they can’t be accessed from outside our class, we will be setting them as private. These variables will be used to store the host, username, password and database for the connection. Since they will pretty much remain constant throughout, we don’t even need to create modifier or accessor methods for it. After that, we’d just need to create a simple mysql statement to connect to the database. Of course, since as programmers we always have to assume the user (even if it is us) will do something stupid, lets add an extra layer of precaution. We can check if the user has actually connected to the database first, and if they have, there really isn’t a need to re-connect. If they haven’t then we can use their credentials to connect.

    function connect()
    {
    /*
     * DSN - PDO to connect
     */
    $dsn = 'mysql:host=' . DB_HOST . ';dbname=' . DB_NAME;

    // attempt to create a connection to the database
    try {
        $connection = new \PDO($dsn, DB_USER, DB_PASS);
    } catch (\PDOException $e) {
        /*
         * connection error if not access
         */
        print 'ERROR - there was a problem trying to create DB connection' . PHP_EOL;
        return null;
    }
    return $connection;
    }

As you can see, it makes use of some basic mysql functions and a bit of error checking to make sure that things are going according to plan. If it connects to the database successfully it will return true, and if not, it will return false. As an added bonus it will also set the connection variable to true if the connection was successfully complete.

###### public function insert()
This function is a lot simpler than our prior one. It simply allows us to insert information into the database. As such we will require an additional argument to the name of the table. We will require a variable that corresponds to the values we wish to input. We can simply separate each value with a comma. Then, all we need to do is quickly check to see if our tableExists, and then build the insert statement by manipulating our arguments to form an insert statement. Then we just run our query.

        /*
         * insert a product in database
         */
        function insert_product($db, $description, $quantity, $price)
        {
            $sql = "INSERT into products (id, description, quantity, price) VALUES ('id','$description', $quantity, $price)";
            $rowsAffected= $db->exec($sql);
            if ($rowsAffected > 0){
                return true;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }

As you can see, this function is a lot simpler than our rather complex select statement. Our delete function will actually be even simpler.

###### public function delete()

This function simply deletes either a table or a row from our database. As such we must pass the table name and an optional where clause. The where clause will let us know if we need to delete a row or the whole table. If the where clause is passed, that means that entries that match will need to be deleted. After we figure all that out, it’s just a matter of compiling our delete statement and running the query.

    /*
     * delete one product from DB
     */
    function delete_product($db, $id)
    {
        $sql = "DELETE FROM products WHERE id = $id";
        $rowsAffected = $db->exec($sql);
        if ($rowsAffected > 0){
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
###### public function update()
And finally we get to our last major function. This function simply serves to update a row in the database with some new information. However, because of the slightly more complex nature of it, it will come off as a bit larger and infinitely more confusing. Never fear, it follows much of the same pattern of our previous function. First it will use our arguments to create an update statement. It will then proceed to check the database to make sure that the tableExists. If it exists, it will simply update the appropriate row. The hard part, of course, comes when we try and create the update statement. Since the update statement has rules for multiple entry updating (IE – different columns in the same row via the cunning use of comma’s), we will need to take that into account and create a way to deal with it. I have opted to pass the where clause as a single array. The first element in the array will be the name of the column being updated, and the next will be the value of the column. In this way, every even number (including 0) will be the column name, and every odd number will be the new value. The code for performing this is very simple, and is presented below outside the function:
                       
        /*
         * Update products
         */
        function update_product($db, $id, $description, $quantity, $price)
        {
            $sql = "UPDATE products SET description = '$description', quantity = $quantity, price = $price WHERE id=$id";
            $rowsAffected= $db->exec($sql);
            if ($rowsAffected > 0){
                return true;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }

Now that we have that we’ve finished our last function, our simple CRUD interface for MySQL is complete. You can now create new entries, read specific entries from the database, update entries and delete things. Also, be creating and reusing this class you’ll find that you are saving yourself a lot of time and coding. Ah, the beauty of object oriented programming.

####    Generating doctrine with Sympfony

#####   Usage

The generate:doctrine:entity command generates a new Doctrine entity stub including the mapping definition and the class properties, getters and setters.

By default, the command is run in the interactive mode and asks questions to determine the bundle name, location, configuration format and default structure:

    $   php app/console generate:doctrine:entity
