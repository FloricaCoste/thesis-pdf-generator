## Citation in fiugure caption
This is how you insert figures using markdown. Also how to insert citations copied over from your bibliography manager (I specifically used Pandoc Citations in Papers).

See Figure \ref{mitosis} for a schematic illustration.

You need to insert empty lines at the end of each section.....
