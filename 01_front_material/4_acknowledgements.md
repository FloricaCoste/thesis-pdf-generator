\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I am very thankful to my group coordinator Maria Brennan and 
supervisor  Matt Smith who guided me  in  a  best  professional way. 

I  would  like  to  dedicate  this work to my husband Florin and my little boys: Alex and Bogdi.

I am indebted to my classmates  as  they  made  it  a  wonderful  place  to  learn.
